Recognizing the worldwide popularity of the Cricket World Cup, our team has embarked on an exciting project to enhance the enjoyment of this prestigious tournament for fans. Our central mission is to create an interactive Quiz Game that will encourage greater fan engagement.
The core concept revolves around enabling users to participate in the quiz through various channels: by purchasing match tickets, placing online food orders, or doing transactions through specific apps. By doing so, participants earn the opportunity to play the quiz game. To make it attractive, we offer a variety of rewards, including discount coupons, gift cards, and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for one lucky user to have their face displayed on the big screen during a match.
The main attraction of this quiz game is the grand prize: a fully sponsored ticket of the final match of the Cricket World Cup. We are committed to covering all expenses to provide the ultimate fun experience.
